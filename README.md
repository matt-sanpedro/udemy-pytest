# Design and Build Test Framework with Python Pytest

## Introduction
- how to design/build an effective testing framework
- test automation, tools, test design and best practices
- build a robust/scalable test framework
- components of test framework:
    * utils
    * data
    * scripts
- GOAL: write tests in a structured manner

## Test Framework
- extensibility and maintenance: easy to enhance and add test cases
- utils/library: contain all reusable functions
- data driven capability: handle test scripts and data separately
- modular: proper file/folder structure for Tests, separate UI, API tests, business logic, etc
- logging and reporting mechanism, separate logging
- versioning, build, and continuous integration
- write structured tests for intermediate learners

## By end of course
- design own test framework from scratch
- understand the components in any test framework
- suggest changes to existing frameworks
- organize test properly
- learn API automation
